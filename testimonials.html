                  The basics were clearly given. It was a hands on experience
                  where in i was able to see the changes take place
                  simultaneously. And the speaker was also very clear in
                  teaching and he cleared doubts regularly. Great session
                  indeed.

                  First and foremost, I'd like to express my gratitude to
                  Hackclub for its brilliant concept and positive impact on the
                  lives of college students. It is because of hackclub that I am
                  now working in the field of augmented reality and virtual
                  reality. I learned about the field's new dimensions and the
                  breadth of its real-world applications. The knowledge I gained
                  and the fantastic contacts I made as a result of this club
                  will be with me for the rest of my life.

                  I am the chair of SKN IEEE Student Branch (SKN-ISB). Our
                  Student Branch had invited Mrunank Pawar the Lead of Hackclub
                  TechBrewers to conduct a workshop on Spark-AR. It was a very
                  interactive responsive session. The conduction was very well
                  managed and held by Mrunank Pawar and Team along with SKN ISB
                  Team. It was indeed a great session! We would love to
                  collaborate once again if the opportunity presents itself in
                  the near future!
